Traditional Irish genealogies represented as Turtle RDF graphs.

This project is to transform the early Irish geneologies from HTML and XML in the [CELT](http://celt.ucc.ie) site
into a computer readable [Turtle RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).  This will allow researchs to manipulate and 
visualize the genealogies programmatically.  This should allow researchers a more reliable and quicker way to study 
the various genealogies.
